# Name TBD 
A program to help content creators diversify their platforms by automating short-form clips from longer videos.

# Inspiration
As a friend to many content creators and as a content creator myself, the most difficult part of growing your platform is getting people to see it. Algorithm this, algorithm that, what I have found in my research is that the key to growing on any platform is consistency.
Consistency requires that you have and prepare content to go out on a set schedule but with the rise of short-form content clips have to be interesting and you need a lot of them for the platform to push your content to an audience. Most people start content creation as a hobby. Pouring full-time hours to make content is a luxury that very few can afford when bills have to be paid. This is where my program slides in.
Using OpenAI to analyze long-form content, whether it's a podcast, livestream, or video essay, it will identify exciting moments of your stream and return them back for you. Long gone are the days of scrubbing through a 5 hour stream at 4x speed.
